# 3D Visualization of fMRI time series

Team contributors: François Paugam

## Summary 

I am interested in developping some 3D viewing tools for fMRI time series data, but I am open to adapt this idea to fit an other project.

## Project definition 

### Background

I am a computer science PhD student at Université de Montréal and have already some experience with python and in deep learning. 

### Tools 

I am thinking of using the d3 javascript library for visualization. Also maybe leveraging from the nilearn visualization tools could be interesting.

### Data 

fMRI time series data.

### Deliverables

The idea is to have an inline 3D plotter usable in jupyter notebooks. 

## Results 

### Progress overview

Definitive subject to be determined, teamates to be found.

### Tools I learned during this project

Planning on learning d3.js
 
### Results 

#### Deliverable 1: 



#### Deliverable 2: 

 
 
## Conclusion and acknowledgement

The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.
